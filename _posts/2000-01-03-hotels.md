## Getting Here

If you're flying in, you @@@@


**How do I get to my hotel from the airport MetroLink?**

- Get on the Metrolink (there's only one line -- the *Red Line* Eastbound toward Shiloh-Scott) and
get off at either the **8th and Pine** station (for the XXXXXXXXXX),
or the **Convention Center** station (for the XXXXXXXX).

- The MetroLink tickets are a little weird. After buying your ticket, you must **validate** it at
a timestamping machine. Be sure to do that before getting on the train -- there's no turnstyle!



**I'm driving, where can I park?**
