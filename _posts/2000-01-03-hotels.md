You can also stay at the [Renaissance Grand](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/stldt-renaissance-st-louis-grand-hotel/){:target="_blank"} (but it's more expensive), or the [Chase Park Plaza](http://www.chaseparkplaza.com/){:target="_blank"} (farther away).

**How do I get to the hotel/venue from the airport MetroLink?**

- Get on the Metrolink (there's only one line -- the Red Line, Eastbound toward Shiloh-Scott) and
get off at the **Convention Center** station.

- MetroLink tickets are strange: After buying your ticket, you must **validate** it at
a timestamping machine. Be sure to do that before getting on the train -- there's no turnstyle.
