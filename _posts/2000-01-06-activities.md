## <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i> Active <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i> 

**[Half-Marathon/10K/5K on Sunday](http://gostlouis.org/events/the-great-halloween-race/){:target="_blank"}** - The Great GO! St. Louis Halloween Race is taking place downtown on Sunday, October 11th. Sign up (or just show up) and run the fun run, 5K, 10K or the half!

**[The City "Museum"](http://www.citymuseum.org/){:target="_blank"}** - If you’ve ever wanted to be a hamster, this is a can’t-miss stop! It's an artsy, adult-sized playground built with welded pieces of old industrial St. Louis.
Highlights include a 10-story slide, a bus cantilevered off the roof of the building, and a prop-plane atop a crane (that you can climb).

**[Forest Park](http://www.forestparkforever.org/park-attractions/){:target="_blank"}** - Forest Park has enough to keep you busy for days -- and everything in it is free! There’s the zoo, science center, history museum, art museum, and tons of running and biking trails. There’s also a public golf course!

**[The Botanical Gardens](http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/){:target="_blank"}** - If you're willing to drive a few minutes south, these gardens are a cool place to check out. There’s something in bloom basically year-round.

## <i class="fa fa-binoculars"></i> Sights <i class="fa fa-binoculars"></i>

**[The St. Louis Arch](http://www.gatewayarch.com/ ){:target="_blank"}** - It’s the iconic structure of the city! There is currently a ton of construction around that area, with street closings, etc. but the arch itself is still open for visits. A ticket is required if you want to actually go up to the top. You can find more information at:

**[Busch Stadium and Ballpark Village](http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/ballpark/){:target="_blank"}** - Every St. Louisan bleeds red, and no, not just because that’s the normal color of blood… Go Cards! To translate for the Wisconsinites - this is the Missouri version of the sacred green and gold! The stadium is downtown and the city just recently constructed a pretty cool ballpark village around it. There’s a possibility that post-season Cardinals will be in town our wedding weekend - if you see an almost inexplicable quantity of red and white, you’ll know why. You can find more information at:
 
**[Budweiser Brewery](http://www.budweisertours.com/locations/st-louis-missouri.html){:target="_blank"}** - We’re craft beer people, but this brewery is pretty cool to tour - from the sheer scale of production to the actual clydesdales. You can find more information at:

**[The Cathedral Basilica](http://cathedralstl.org/ ){:target="_blank"}** - This place has the world’s largest collection of mosaics, and it is impressive! You can find more information at:

**[Art Museums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_and_cultural_institutions_in_Greater_St._Louis#Art ){:target="_blank"}** - St. Louis has about as many art museums as they do microbreweries!
