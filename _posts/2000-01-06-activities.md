* **[Half-Marathon/10K/5K on Sunday](http://gostlouis.org/events/the-great-halloween-race/){:target="_blank"}** - The Great GO! St. Louis Halloween Race is happening downtown on Sunday, October 11th. Sign up (or just show up) and run the fun run, 5K, 10K or the half!

* **[The City "Museum"](http://www.citymuseum.org/){:target="_blank"}** - If you’ve ever wanted to be a hamster, this is a can’t-miss stop! It's an artsy, adult-sized playground built with welded pieces from old St. Louis buildings.
Highlights include a 10-story slide, a bus cantilevered off the roof, and a prop-plane atop a crane (that you can climb).

* **[Forest Park](http://www.forestparkforever.org/park-attractions/){:target="_blank"}** - Forest Park has enough to keep you busy for days -- and everything in it is free! There’s the zoo, science center, history museum, art museum, and tons of running and biking trails. There’s also a public golf course!

* **[World Chess Hall of Fame](http://www.worldchesshof.org/){:target="_blank"}** - St. Louis is the US Chess Capital. Seriously. Visit the Central West End and see live chess games, a museum, and life-size chess pieces.

* **[The St. Louis Zoo](http://www.stlzoo.org/){:target="_blank"}** - Entrance is free and they have a ton of animals - highlights include: **penguins** and puffins, a **red panda**, and a new polar bear. It's a great place to walk around.

* **[Piles of Art Museums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_museums_and_cultural_institutions_in_Greater_St._Louis#Art ){:target="_blank"}** - St. Louis has about as many art museums as we do microbreweries! And for those of you interested in arts and crafts (get the pun?) that’s good news. We like:
  * [SLAM](http://www.slam.org/){:target="_blank"} - The big, famous one in Forest Park.
  * [The Kemper](http://kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"} - Hip stuff at WashU's undergrad campus

* **[The St. Louis Arch](http://www.gatewayarch.com/ ){:target="_blank"}** - This year is the **50th anniversary** of The Arch! The archgrounds are busy with construction for the festivities, but it's navigable on foot. You can even ride up to the top (if you buy a ticket).

* **[Busch Stadium and Ballpark Village](http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/ballpark/){:target="_blank"}** - Go Cards! (This is the Missouri version of Wisconsin's sacred green and gold.) The stadium is downtown and surrounded by shops at Ballpark Village. There's a good chance that the Cardinals will be playing post-season games during our wedding weekend.
