## *Got some downtime?*

### There's tons to do in the StL!


## Active

Marathon on Sunday -

City Museum - The name is a bit of a misnomer - this place is one of the most unique sites in St. Louis. If you’ve ever wanted to be a hamster, this is a can’t-miss stop! It is basically an artsy, adult-sized playground constructed out of welded together pieces of the old industrial city. Highlights include a 10-story slide, a bus on the roof of the building, and a mid air prop-plane that you can climb up to and inside of.  You can find more information at:
http://www.citymuseum.org/

Forest Park - We love this place! Forest Park has enough to keep you busy for days - and almost everything within it is free! There’s the zoo, science museum, history museum, art museum, and tons of running and biking trails. There’s also a golf course - where you can book a tee time if you want! You can find more information at:

Botanical Gardens - If you’re willing to venture a short distance out of downtown, these gardens are a cool place to check out. There’s something in bloom basically year-round. You can find more information at:

## Sights

The St. Louis Arch - It’s the iconic structure of the city! There is currently a ton of construction around that area, with street closings, etc. but the arch itself is still open for visits. A ticket is required if you want to actually go up to the top. You can find more information at:

Busch Stadium and Ballpark Village - Every St. Louisan bleeds red, and no, not just because that’s the normal color of blood… Go Cards! To translate for the Wisconsinites - this is the Missouri version of the sacred green and gold! The stadium is downtown and the city just recently constructed a pretty cool ballpark village around it. There’s a possibility that post-season Cardinals will be in town our wedding weekend - if you see an almost inexplicable quantity of red and white, you’ll know why. You can find more information at:

Budweiser Brewery - We’re craft beer people, but this brewery is pretty cool to tour - from the sheer scale of production to the actual clydesdales. You can find more information at:

The Cathedral Basilica - This place has the world’s largest collection of mosaics, and it is impressive! You can find more information at:
