## *Got some downtime?*

### There's tons to do in the StL!

<br>

## Active

[Half-Marathon/10K/5K on Sunday](http://gostlouis.org/events/the-great-halloween-race/) - The Great GO! St. Louis Halloween Race is taking place downtown on Sunday, October 11th. Sign up (or just show up) and run the fun run, 5K, 10K or the half!

[City Museum](http://www.citymuseum.org/) - The name is a bit of a misnomer -- this place is one of the most unique sites in St. Louis. If you’ve ever wanted to be a hamster, this is a can’t-miss stop! It is basically an artsy, adult-sized playground constructed out of welded together pieces of the old industrial city.
Highlights include a 10-story slide, a bus on the roof of the building, and a mid air prop-plane that you can climb up to and inside of.

[Forest Park](http://www.forestparkforever.org/park-attractions/) - Forest Park has enough to keep you busy for days -- and everything in it is free! There’s the zoo, science center, history museum, art museum, and tons of running and biking trails. There’s also a public golf course!

[Botanical Gardens](http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/) - If you're willing to drive a few minutes south, these gardens are a cool place to check out. There’s something in bloom basically year-round.

## Sights

The St. Louis Arch - It’s the iconic structure of the city! There is currently a ton of construction around that area, with street closings, etc. but the arch itself is still open for visits. A ticket is required if you want to actually go up to the top. You can find more information at:
http://www.gatewayarch.com/ 

Busch Stadium and Ballpark Village - Every St. Louisan bleeds red, and no, not just because that’s the normal color of blood… Go Cards! To translate for the Wisconsinites - this is the Missouri version of the sacred green and gold! The stadium is downtown and the city just recently constructed a pretty cool ballpark village around it. There’s a possibility that post-season Cardinals will be in town our wedding weekend - if you see an almost inexplicable quantity of red and white, you’ll know why. You can find more information at:

Budweiser Brewery - We’re craft beer people, but this brewery is pretty cool to tour - from the sheer scale of production to the actual clydesdales. You can find more information at:

The Cathedral Basilica - This place has the world’s largest collection of mosaics, and it is impressive! You can find more information at:

---------------------------------

## Chill

Science Center - Because who doesn’t love science? Or the stars - there’s also a planetarium! You can find more information at: 
http://www.slsc.org/ 

Zoo - Entrance is free and they have a ton of animals - highlights include: penguins! and puffins, a red panda, and a new polar bear. There’s a Dippin Dots stand and it’s a great place to walk around. You can find more information at: 
http://www.stlzoo.org/

Art Museums - St. Louis has about as many art museums as they do microbreweries! And for those of you interested in arts and crafts (get the pun?) that’s good news… You can check out everything from traditional to modern art. You can find more information at: (see section on art)
