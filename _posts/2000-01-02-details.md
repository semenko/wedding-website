## Meet us in St. Louis!

- **When?** --- Saturday, October 10th, 2015
- **Where?** --- St. Louis, MO


### The Venue

The ceremony and reception are both at **The Old Post Office** (which is not actually a post office).

- Address: 815 Olive St, St. Louis MO, 631010 --- ( [Get a Map](https://goo.gl/maps/Y9vRf) )
    
Oh-- go see [some examples](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged#fancy-jekyll-powered-single-page-site)!

- Each vertical section is a markdown file in **_posts/** directory.
  * They're sorted by 'date'. (we don't use date anywhere, it only sorts)
- Each vertical section sets it's own **color**, **header icon** (or image), **title**, and easy-to-write markdown body.
- Only **two things** to edit:
  1. Edit `_config.yml` to set the site title, description, etc
  2. Add `_posts/*.md` to make each vertical section. Copy some examples and add the sections from your README.md for a fast start!
- Easy adding of **SEO terms**, **favicon** & such, and **google analytics token**.
